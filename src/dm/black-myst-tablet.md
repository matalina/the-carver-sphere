If found in the black myst there is a quicker way to return to the Carver Sphere.  The stone for this was broken by Carver Centuries ago, but the translation is found in the Journal left by the Inn Keeper when a character first arrives.  Carver did not destroy the other two stone carvings because he cannot see them.  They are the Sphere's way of providing a way out of its domain against its creators designs.
