Before beginning an actual adventure this session should be completed.

# Waking Up

You wake up in a barren room on a creaky and lumpy bed in the corner of a 25' x 20' room. There is a sold oak chest in the corner to your right.  And in the far opposite corner you can smell sausage and eggs freshly cooked waiting with a hot cup of coffee.  

There is a single chair at the circular table with the waiting meal, a candle flickers lighting an open book.  

As you look around you also notice a backpack at the foot of the bed and a bucket in the corner you face lying in bed.  

The simple wooden door in the middle of the south wall is your only exit and means of escape.

## Look inside the Chest

**Roll 1d10**

In the chest you find a set of gear _(this is the gear you choose at character creation)_ and a pouch filled with gold coins _(500gp + 1d10 x 25gp)_.


## Look in the Book

**Roll 1d100** _until a free token slot is available_

As you look at the book you feel a sort of kinship with it like it's part of you and you are part of it.  

The book is open to a page with a wooden coin drawn into ink vibrant purple ink.  You've seen the coin before, you recently obtained a likeness.  The opposite page calls the coin a Carver Token.  And it begins to tell you about the coin.

The page reads:

_A Carver Token is attuned to an individual.  The token when placed in a Carver Receptacle transports the individual into a Carver Stronghold.  You are currently inside of yours._

_For whatever reason, the Carver Token has sought you out and brought you to the Carver Sphere where you will live out the rest of your days._

_The gold in the pouch and the gear are gifts of our great lord Carver Saint d'Clair's token.  He and all of his grateful subjects wish to welcome you to the realm._

_Use this journal for whatever purposes you like.  The first few pages detail some of the finer points to your Carver Token and your associated Carver Shtronghold._

_Your carver token is: **rolled number**.  Should another take it from you, you will be trapped here forever._

## Open the Door

As you reach for the door, you feel the presence of another and words form in your head.  _I am your Stronghold.   I am only as powerful as you.  The more power you gain, the more I gain.  The stronger our bond._  

_I can take on whatever form you desire, my current presentation is only a glimpse what what I can offer.  My space is limited only by my power, and I cannot grant magical items or functional items outside of  myself.  But with in the confines of my existence, you can remake and reshape me until you are stratified._

Before the doorknob has turned completely the voice booms in your head. _Do not forget to pick up the **rolled number** token from the receptacle when you appear.  The token may not be 5 feet from your body if you wish me to retain all my power and contents._  

### Look in the Backpack

The backpack is a leather pack with two straps to secure it to your back . It can hold 1 cubic foot/ 30 pounds of gear.

You can also strap items, such as a bedroll or a coil of rope, to the outside of a backpack. _(This is part of your starting gear package -- only 1 backpack total.)_

Inside the back pack is 1 leather pouch _(A leather pouch can hold 1/5 cubic foot/ 6 pounds of gear - or up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things)_ .
