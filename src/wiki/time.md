# {{ title }}

In the Carver Sphere everything is static.

Once a living thing matures to adulthood it does not age in the Carver Sphere.  Old age is a thing of the past, and [Carver](./carver-saint-dclair) has acheived immortality.

The weather is [Carver](./carver-saint-dclair)'s favorite, a nice spring day that has a nice northwesterly breeze.  The temperature is not too hot, and not too cold -- perfect for short sleeves and shorts.  

The day never changes, the moon is the only thing that can determine the passage of time.

The denziens of the Carver Sphere have created a calendar based upon the moon's cycle of 40 days. The start of the new month begins at the peak of the Full Moon.

A new day begins when the moon is at its peak in the night sky.  The revolution of the day takes 32 hours half of which are day, and half night. (16 hours of daylight, and 16 hours of darkness)

The denizens of the Carver Sphere decided that every fourth day of the month should be a day of rest.

Since there are no season, the denizens group ten months into a year.
