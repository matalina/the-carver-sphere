# {{ title }}

The Dead Sea once was a wide blue ocean upon which the Pirates of the Deep once ruled.  The ocean dried up upon the creation of the Sphere crashing the ship into the earth and the pirates became bandits.

As @[](uwgaxxtqeq)'s power grew so did the powers of other creatures.  A phoenix now has a lair near the Dark Mountains.
