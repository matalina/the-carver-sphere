# {{ title }}

The Caverns of Time is a network of caves that leads to a cavern with two portals.

One portal is a two way door and only Traveling Merchant has the key to open the portal.

One portal opens at various intervals releasing various monsters at various levels depending on how many adventurers are actively seeking adventures.
