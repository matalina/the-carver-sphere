# {{ title }}

Ignax is an Ancient Red Dragon who files over the [Dark Mountains](./dark-mountains).  He mostly leaves the [village](./saint-carver) alone, but sometimes when bored he will straif the crops and steal the food animals for his own dinner.  Ignax prefers to terrorize [Carver Tower](./carver-tower) and it's [owner](./carver-saint-dclair).
