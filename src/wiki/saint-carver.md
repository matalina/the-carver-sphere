# {{ title }}

Saint Carver is a quaint village on the edge of The Dying Lands.  The cliff side serves as a defensable position for anything coming up from the ravine below.  A guard tower is situated over looking the north to alert the village of any impending danger.

Most of the villagers are normal folk who were brought in to make life easier for the Carver Sphere adventures.  The village grew up around them.  There is a handful of former adventures in the village who now live the mundane life.  Some pay their services out and others hide in plain sight.

The Violent Wolf Inn sit center of the village.

Lush farmland to the south grow all the crops that the villagers could ever need.  Since there are no seasons, they plant the fields in quater cycles.  At any given time there is always a crop to harvest, land to till and seeds to sow.

To the south, the green grass of the plateau looking over the ravine is a host to the village's free range live stock.  The livestock mingle with wild prarie animals and are hunted by the wolves and other predators.  Daily hunting patrols and the shepherds keep the village fully stocked with animal proteins.

Saint Carver has a small market area where an adventurer can find many sorts of daily items and even rare and magical ones.  The market is supplied once a month by a Traveling Merchant who brings in a caravan of new workers, adventures and stock.  Special orders can be placed with the merchants and will be passed on to the Peddleer on his next arrival.  

The village also has its own Dwarven black smith and leather worker. Not to mention the trades that allow the village to grow including a miller, carpenter, lumber yard and mason.

For those looking for spiritual enlightment the Community Hall has daily services for the Many Faced God as well as provides an education to the children of the village. The Community Hall is also host to a bulletin board where villagers can leave requests for help from adventures looking for something to do.

Many guilds set up shop in the Guild Hall.
