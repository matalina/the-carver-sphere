A [Carver Token](./carver-token) is attuned to an individual. The token when placed in a [Carver Receptacle](./carver-receptacle) transports the individual into a [Carver Stronghold](./carver-stronghold). You are currently inside of yours.

For whatever reason, the Carver Token has sought you out and brought you to the Carver Sphere where you will live out the rest of your days.

The gold in the pouch and the gear are gifts of our great lord [Carver Saint d'Clair](./carver-saint-dclair)'s token. He and all of his grateful subjects wish to welcome you to the realm.

Use this journal for whatever purposes you like. The first few pages detail some of the finer points to your Carver Token and your associated Carver Shtronghold.

Your carver token is: **rolled number**. Should another take it from you, you will be trapped here forever.
