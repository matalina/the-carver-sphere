# {{ title }}

The Blacky Myst was created when [Carver](./carver-saint-dclair) put a protection spell over the land he called home drawing the Shadowfell energies to the home plane.  Extended exposure to the myst will kill a person in three days.

However if a person knows the pattern they may use the Black Myst to return to their home land.  Some adventureres have found their way out but have not shared the secret with anyone.
