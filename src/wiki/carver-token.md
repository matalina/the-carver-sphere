# {{ title }}

There are 100 Carver Tokens in existence. Each one instills the attuned creature with a unique stronghold based on the creature's power. As the creature increases in power so too does the stronghold and it grows in size and ability.

The token is made of magical wood stolen from The World Tree. On one side a star is carved and on the other is a two digit rune indicating which number token it is.
