## Character Creation

All characters must have a [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) Character sheet.  You may choose any type of character you'd like as long as it can be created on D&D Beyond is public.  You are free to use whatever the DM has purchased and shared with [the campaign](https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/3339438553531512).

Your character may have any type of history you'd like as it will not matter in the Carver Sphere.  Your allies and enemies will not be able to help or harm you here.

You may create a character between Level 1 and Level 3.  But keep in mind the more you level the more powerful your [Carver Stronghold](./carver-stronghold) will become as well.

### Rules

* While creating your character you may use the Optional Class Features and Customize your Origin.  
* We will use the Experience points for advancement type and Fixed Hit Points.
* Also check both feats and multiclass prerequisites.
* We will be using encumbrance but ignoring the weight of coins.
* Do not use legacy content while generating a new character.
* Roll for Ability Scores (Manual/Roll generation method).  You may Roll all 6 scores twice.  You may only use one group or the other do not mix and match.
* Insure your character has at least two personality traits listed, 1 ideal, 1 bond and 1 flaw. You can create these yourself, or use the pregenerated ones offered.
* Make sure to provide a bare minimum of description in the Physical Characteristics Section. 
* A minimal backstory should be provided, though it has little bearing on the world going forward, but will provide insight for you as your role play your character.  
* Organizations, allies and enemies do not matter, though you are welcome to have them as part of your backstory.
* If there are things you'd like to do please add them to the other section and we can see what we can do.
* Use the Starting equipment at character generation.  Additional information will be supplied in Session 0.
