# {{ title }}

A Carver Stronghold is tied to a specific usage of a [Carver Token](./carver-token). An attuned creature can change and manipulate the stronghold at will while inside the structure.

The structure is sentient and only as powerful as the creature attuned to it minus the power the creature had when it first attuned to the Carver Token.

<div class="note"> 
ie: If a creature attunes to a Carver Token at level 3 and gains 3 levels the stronghold is Level 3.
</div>


If attunement is lost all power and items inside of the stronghold are also lost.  You can lose attunement by leaving your stronghold and the Carver Token for more than one hour.  Your Carver Token must remain on your person to retain attunement, however your stronghold if powerful enough can be anchored permanently in a singular location you have designated with the Anchor Ritual.

If you die with the Carver Token on your person, the stronghold appears on top of your corpse the following night if no one picks up the token.  Your corpse is translated to the furthest location in the stronghold.  The stronghold takes on a n abandoned appearance until someone else picks up the token.
