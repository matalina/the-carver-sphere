Deep inside everyone has a dark spot where the shadows can grow. Most don't open the door and let it out -- others do just that.  [Carver Saint d'Clair](./wiki/carver-saint-dclair) opened the door this darkness the moment he made the pact with a Hexblade he stumbled upon in his home plane.  The blade compelled him to dark places and in those places a hunger to protect his home drove him mad. And in this madness Carver Saint d'Claire sent all manner of creatures to 'protect' his home.  

In a moment of lucid awakening Carver cast a protection spell that created the [Black Myst](./wiki/black-myst) that surrounds the realm encapsulating a thirty mile sphere of his home with in an orb protected by the Shadowfell itself.  The spell broke Carver's soul into 100 bits and scattered them throughout the realms know to all beings casting a coin forged of magics that when touched by mortals brings them to Carver's land inside the orb.  Their bodies lie dormant in their home plane with Carver Syndrome, and should they die in the orb they so too shall die in their real world.  

But it is possible to escape, one only must find the way and give up all that Carver's dream can offer you -- endless adventure, treasure, and even a home.

The [Carver Tokens](./wiki/carver-token) are drawn to seasoned adventurers. Some wake up to find the coin lying on a table near by, others find it amidst treasures of their vanquished foes  and other have taken it from a hapless fool who had no idea what they held.  

The token doesn't care if you are born of magic, or a time that sees little technological advance or the most sophisticated machinery known.  It's all relative once you enter the dream of Carver Syndrome, it all translates to his world.
